# Output Examples

Read before producing the report for a formatting refresher. The `Ready for handoff` tier always states the lint/type-check/test baseline from workflow step 2.

## End-of-session self-review

```markdown
## Local review

### Must fix before push
- [major] `src/profile/page.tsx:42` Missing null guard before dereferencing `profile`
  Why: `profile` can be `null` on the first render, so `profile.id` throws before the loading state can complete.
  Fix: Guard `profile` before dereferencing, or move the access into the branch that handles loaded data.

### Should fix soon
- [minor] `src/components/profile-card.tsx:18` API mapping bypasses repository mapper rule
  Why: The changed code casts the API payload directly in the component, but the scoped instruction file requires explicit mapping in a dedicated mapper.
  Fix: Move the payload transformation into the existing mapper module and pass the mapped UI model to the component.

### Ready for handoff
- Not ready until the must-fix items are addressed. Baseline: lint and type check clean; 2 test failures in `payments` pre-date this change.
```

The all-clear shape (`None.` under both fix tiers) lives in SKILL.md; only the baseline line varies: state what was checked plus the lint/type-check/test result.
