## Verdict + tier semantics

`verdict` is computed from per-finding tiers:

| Verdict | Condition |
|---|---|
| `READY` | 0 release-blockers AND ≤3 fix-this-sprint |
| `READY_WITH_FOLLOW_UP` | 0 release-blockers AND ≥4 fix-this-sprint |
| `NOT_READY` | ≥1 release-blocker |
| `INCOMPLETE` | `audit.selfCheck.passed === false` |

`tier` per finding is one of: `release-blocker | fix-this-sprint | backlog`.

Default tier comes from the rule's frontmatter (`defaultTier`); the rule's `surfaceOverrides` table can bump it up or down per detected feature. Always include `defaultTier`, `assignedTier`, and `tierReason`.

## Self-check codes

`audit.selfCheck.failures[]` is empty on a clean audit. Codes:

```
"rules-not-fully-executed"     // rulesRun < rulesPlanned
"too-many-unknown"             // > 30% of run rules returned "unknown"
"no-evidence-cited"            // No file:line on any fail/warn finding
"no-fix-provided"              // Some fail/warn findings missing `fix`
"implausible-timing"           // Median time-per-rule too short to be real
"uniform-tier"                 // All findings ended in same tier (suspect blanket)
```

If `failures[]` is non-empty, set `verdict: "INCOMPLETE"`.

## Finding (modern, Layer 2)

```json
{
  "rule": "forms-lost-data-on-error",
  "layer": "modern",

  "assignedTier": "fix-this-sprint",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "observed": "Toast is a visual-only div with no role or aria-live attribute.",
  "fix": "Use `role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\"` for informational toasts and `role=\"alert\"` for urgent errors."
}
```

## Finding (laws, Layer 4)

  "severity": "HIGH",
  "observed": { "count": 5 },
  "expected": { "max": 3 },
  "fix": "Modal footers should expose ≤3 actions; consolidate or move secondary actions to a meta-menu."
}
```

## Finding (rubric, Layer 4)

```json
{
  "rule": "perception-pragnanz",
  "layer": "laws",
  "kind": "rubric",
  "feature": "marketing-hero",
  "surface": "Hero",
  "file": "src/Hero.tsx",
  "line": 12,
  "result": "warn",
  "defaultTier": "backlog",
  "assignedTier": "backlog",
  "severity": "MEDIUM",
  "score": 3,
  "anchor": "Multiple visual centers of gravity; user must decide where to look first.",
  "fix": "Establish one dominant focal shape per section; align the hero CTA to a single grid; remove the competing tilted card."
}
```

## Finding (unknown)

```json

  "rule": "async-out-of-order-responses",
  "layer": "modern",
  "category": "async",
  "feature": "search",
  "surface": "SearchBar",
  "file": "src/search/SearchBar.tsx",

}
```

## Field reference

| Field | Required when | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `rule` | always | kebab-case slug matching a file in `rules-modern/`, `rules-surface/`, or `rules/` |
| `layer` | always | `modern` (Layer 2), `surface` (Layer 3), or `laws` (Layer 4) |
| `category` | layer=modern | `forms | states | async | focus | mobile | dark-i18n | microcopy` |
| `category` | layer=surface | `a11y | interaction | forms | type | nav | layout | perf | motion | copy` |
| `prefix` | layer=laws | `cognitive | decision | perception | memory | interaction` |
| `kind` | layer=laws | `programmatic | rubric` (from the rule's frontmatter; rubric rules also emit `score` + `anchor`) |
| `feature` | always | feature playbook this finding came from (`checkout`, `sign-in`, etc.) |
| `surface` | always | component or page name (PascalCase, no extension) |
| `file` | when result ≠ unknown | source file path |
| `line` | when grep reveals it | line number |
| `result` | always | `pass | warn | fail | unknown` |
| `defaultTier` | fail / warn | rule's default tier |
| `assignedTier` | fail / warn | tier after surface overrides applied |
| `tierReason` | when assignedTier ≠ defaultTier | explanation of override |
| `severity` | fail / warn | `HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW` |
| `observed` | Layer 2 or 3 fail | string OR object describing measurement |
| `expected` | Layer 2 or 3 fail (when applicable) | object with rule threshold |
| `score` | Layer 4 rubric | integer 1-5 |
| `anchor` | Layer 4 rubric | verbatim text from rule's rubric table |
| `evidence` | fail (recommended) | array of `file:line: observation` strings |
| `fix` | fail / warn | string with the literal change |
| `fixSnippet` | fail (recommended) | code snippet ready for `suggestion` block |
| `docsLink` | fail (recommended) | URL to React/Next.js doc for the API in the fix |
| `reactApis` | layer=modern | array of React 19 / Next.js APIs used in the fix |
| `suppressed` | always | boolean, true if `// ui-audit-ignore:<slug>` was present |
| `reason` | unknown | why the rule could not produce a verdict |

## Validation rules

- Every `fail` and `warn` finding has `assignedTier`, `severity`, `fix`.
- Every Layer-2 fail finding has `observed`.
- Every Layer-4 rubric finding has `score` AND `anchor`.
- Every `unknown` finding has `reason`.
- Every finding belongs to exactly one `feature` and one `surface`.
- `pass` findings can be elided from the markdown rendering; keep them in JSON for audit-self-check.
- If `audit.selfCheck.passed === false`, set `verdict: "INCOMPLETE"`.
- `summary.suppressed` counts findings where `suppressed: true` (matched a `ui-audit-ignore` comment).
- `assignedTier` defaults to `defaultTier` unless surface override applies; always populate both.
