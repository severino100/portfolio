# Output Adapters

One JSON document, three formats. Build the JSON first, then render to what the user or pipeline wants.

## Adapter 1: Terminal table

For local dev, fast scan in the agent transcript or piped output. Tight, monospace-aware.

```text
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
UX Audit · 8 files · diff vs main
SHIP VERDICT: ❌ NOT READY (1 release-blocker, 3 sprint, 3 backlog)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⛔ src/checkout/PaymentStep.tsx
  L42  release-blocker  forms-lost-data-on-error
       Card number cleared on shipping-address 422 response.
       Fix: hoist form state; use useActionState with field-level errors.

⚠️  src/checkout/PaymentStep.tsx
  L88  fix-this-sprint  states-no-skeleton
       <CardElement> renders during stripe load with no fallback (CLS risk).
       Fix: <Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton h="44px" />}>

⚠️  src/checkout/PaymentStep.tsx
  L102 fix-this-sprint  microcopy-vague-error
       Error: "Something went wrong." Replace with cause + retry path.

⚠️  src/checkout/ConfirmStep.tsx
  L34  fix-this-sprint  focus-not-restored
       Modal closes; focus returns to <body> not the trigger button.
       Fix: pass triggerRef to <Dialog onCloseAutoFocus={...}>

📋 src/checkout/CheckoutForm.tsx
  L12  backlog  dark-i18n-untested
       No dark-mode story or visual regression.

📋 src/checkout/PaymentStep.tsx
  L67  backlog  mobile-hover-only-affordance
       Help tooltip only on hover; touch users miss it.

📋 src/checkout/ConfirmStep.tsx
  L51  backlog  microcopy-generic-loading
       "Loading..." → "Confirming order, this takes 2-3 seconds"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Defer-to:
  Performance (CWV):     Run Lighthouse on /checkout
  Bundle size:           Run next-bundle-analyzer
  WCAG violations:       Run axe-core in Storybook

Audit Self-Check:        ✓ 14 rules run · ✓ all findings cited · ✓ all fixes provided
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Rules:
- Group by surface (file path), severity-sorted within group (blocker → sprint → backlog).
- Unicode emoji for tier (`⛔ ⚠️ 📋`); ASCII fallback (`X ! .`) on `--no-emoji`.
- Line numbers as `L42` not `:42` (easier to spot in terminals).
- Fix is one line; if longer, truncate with `→` and put the full fix in JSON.
- Close with deferred-to and self-check footers.

## Adapter 2: PR comment (GitHub / Vercel review)

For GitHub PR review. Markdown with `suggestion` blocks for inline diffs where possible.

### Top-of-PR comment

```markdown
## 🔍 UX Audit: `feature/checkout-redesign` vs `main`

**Verdict:** ❌ NOT READY

**1 release-blocker** · 3 fix-this-sprint · 3 backlog · 0 unknown

| Surface | ⛔ | ⚠️ | 📋 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CheckoutForm.tsx` | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| `PaymentStep.tsx` | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| `ConfirmStep.tsx` | 0 | 1 | 1 |

<details>
<summary>What this audit checks (and what it doesn't)</summary>

ui-audit catches feature-level UX bugs static analysis can detect from the diff:
state coverage, form data preservation, focus mgmt, optimistic rollback, microcopy.

It does **not** measure performance (run Lighthouse) or replace WCAG rules
(run axe-core / `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`). See [defer-to-other-tools.md](...).

</details>
```

### Inline comments (one per finding)

```markdown
**⛔ release-blocker · `forms-lost-data-on-error`**

Card number is cleared on shipping-address 422 response. The form unmounts
its state when the server returns validation errors on a different field.

```suggestion
const [state, formAction] = useActionState(updateOrder, {
  fields: { card: '', expiry: '', cvc: '' },
  errors: {},
});
```

Hoist form state so field-level errors don't reset unrelated fields.
Use [`useActionState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState)
to keep `state.fields` populated across error responses.

[Suppress this finding: add `{/* ui-audit-ignore:forms-lost-data-on-error */}` above the component.]
```

Rules:
- One inline comment per finding, anchored at the line.
- GitHub `suggestion` blocks where the fix is mechanical (≤5 lines).
- Link React/Next.js docs for the prescribed API.
- Include the suppression hint at the bottom.
- Top-of-PR comment is summary only: no per-finding detail.

## Adapter 3: CI JSON

For pipelines, dashboards, status checks. Emit strict JSON using the output schema for this skill.

```json
{
  "audit": {
    "ranAt": "2026-05-01T12:34:56Z",
    "skill": "ui-audit",

      "fixSnippet": "const [state, formAction] = useActionState(...)",
      "docsLink": "https://react.dev/reference/react/useActionState",
      "tierReason": "Surface is checkout; payment-data loss is money-flow blocker."
    }
  ]
}
```

CI usage:

```bash
# Pipeline check that exits non-zero on release-blockers
ui-audit --format json | jq -e '.summary.releaseBlockers == 0'
```

## Choosing the adapter

| Where the audit runs | Adapter |
|---|---|
| Local terminal (`npm run audit`, agent CLI) | terminal |
| Cursor / Claude Code chat | terminal |
| GitHub PR comment | PR-comment |
| Vercel preview review | PR-comment |
| CI gating (block merge on release-blocker) | JSON + jq |
| Status dashboard | JSON |

## Common rendering rules

- **JSON first.** Render the complete JSON document, then transform to the chosen adapter.
- **Pass findings elide.** Don't render `result: "pass"` findings in terminal or PR adapters; keep them in JSON.
- **One finding = one observable bug.** Don't bundle bugs under one rule; two issues firing the same rule are two findings.
- **Tier-first, surface-second sort.** ⛔ first, ⚠️ next, 📋 last; within tier, group by surface.
