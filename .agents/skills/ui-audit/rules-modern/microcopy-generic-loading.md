## Generic loading copy, "Loading…" with no context

"Loading…" tells the user nothing about *what* is loading or *how long* to expect. A context-specific string ("Confirming your order, 2 to 3 seconds", "Searching invoices…") sets expectations, cuts perceived wait, and stops the user assuming the page is stuck. Low-stakes polish, not a release-blocker, but it compounds on critical paths.

## What goes wrong

User clicks "Place order" and sees "Loading…" for four seconds. They don't know if payment went through, if the page is hung, or if to refresh (which would double-charge). "Confirming your order, please don't refresh" answers all three.

## Detection

**Surfaces:** loading state / skeleton, search, onboarding, dashboard, list, modal.

**Candidate-finding rule.** Regex matches "Loading" / "Please wait"; the agent decides whether each instance is a placeholder that should be specific or an intentionally generic shell (e.g. a `<PageSkeleton>` reused across surfaces, which is fine).

**Static signals:**
1. Grep the exact placeholder phrases as JSX text.
2. For each match, Read context to determine the surface (checkout? search? generic shell?).
3. Judge whether the surface allows a more specific string.

**Concrete commands:**
```bash
# JSX text matches: agent reviews each.
rg -n '>Loading\.{0,3}<' --type=ts src/
rg -n '>Please wait\.?<' --type=ts src/

# Variable-ish placeholders worth checking.
rg -n "'Loading'|\"Loading\"|'Please wait'|\"Please wait\"" --type=ts src/
```

Regex spec: `/^Loading\.{0,3}$/i` and `/^Please wait\.?$/i` against the JSX text content.

**False-positive guards:**
- Skip generic skeleton shells reused across surfaces (`LoadingShell.tsx`, `<PageSkeleton>`, `<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>`). The component name is the contract: its job is to be reusable.
- Skip a11y-only labels (`aria-label="Loading"`): a generic announcement helps screen-reader users. Separate concern.
- Skip Storybook fixtures, tests, MSW.
- Skip files with `// ui-audit-ignore:microcopy-generic-loading`.

**Agent-judgment limit:** "Loading" inside a reusable `<Spinner>` is fine; "Loading" rendered directly in `CheckoutPage.tsx` is not. Decide by file and component name.

## Fix

Replace with the specific operation. Add a duration estimate if it predictably takes >1 second.

```tsx
// before
{isPending && <p>Loading…</p>}

// after: context-specific copy + duration
{isPending && <p aria-live="polite">Confirming your order, 2 to 3 seconds.</p>}

// after: search context
{deferredQuery !== query && <p>Searching invoices…</p>}

// after: combined with useFormStatus
function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  return (
    <button disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? 'Saving your changes…' : 'Save'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Default tier and overrides

**Defaults to:** `backlog`

**Surface overrides:**
| Surface | Tier |
|---|---|
| Checkout (payment processing) | fix-this-sprint |
| Onboarding step transitions | fix-this-sprint |
| Sign-in / Sign-up submit | fix-this-sprint |
| Marketing landing | backlog |
| Internal admin | backlog |

## Examples

**Anti-pattern (fails):**

```tsx
// 1. Generic placeholder
{isLoading && <p>Loading…</p>}

// 2. Even worse on a critical path
<button disabled={pending}>{pending ? 'Please wait' : 'Place order'}</button>

// 3. Generic spinner, no copy
{isPending && <Spinner />}
```

**Applied (passes):**

```tsx
// 1. Specific operation
{isPending && <p>Confirming your order, please don't refresh.</p>}

// 2. Critical path with duration hint
<button disabled={pending}>
  {pending ? 'Charging your card, 2 to 3 seconds…' : 'Place order'}
</button>

// 3. Search with the actual query
{deferredQuery !== query && <p>Searching for "{query}"…</p>}

// 4. Onboarding step transition
{stepTransition && <p>Setting up your workspace, almost there.</p>}
```

## Defer-to (when this is another tool's job)

- **Perceived performance / TTFB / INP**: Lighthouse + web-vitals.
- **Skeleton CLS**: `states-layout-shift` rule.
- **Long-running progress (>10 s)**: needs a progress indicator; see the loading-state feature playbook.

## Suppression

```tsx
{/* ui-audit-ignore:microcopy-generic-loading, generic shell reused across 12 routes */}
<Suspense fallback={<p>Loading…</p>}>
```
