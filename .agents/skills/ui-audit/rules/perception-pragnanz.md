## Law of Prägnanz

The "law of good figure" / "law of simplicity": faced with an ambiguous or complex shape, the eye resolves it into the simplest interpretation, the one costing the least cognitive effort. Simple, regular, unified shapes are processed and remembered faster than complex, irregular ones. Rubric-based: score how cleanly the composition resolves to a single reading.

Prägnanz is the umbrella behind the other Gestalt laws: it is *why* the brain groups by proximity, similarity, region, and connection. If a composition can be misread as a simpler shape, it will be.

## Rubric

**Surfaces:** marketing-hero, dashboard, empty-state, pricing

**Score the surface against the closest anchor:**

| Score | Anchor |
|---|---|
| 5 | Clear figure-ground; each section has one dominant shape; no competing alignments or rotations; eye flow is unambiguous. |
| 4 | Mostly clear; one element competes mildly (e.g. a tilted card in an otherwise gridded layout). |
| 3 | Multiple visual centers of gravity; user has to decide where to look first. |
| 2 | Layered, rotated, overlapping shapes without hierarchy; eye bounces. |
| 1 | Composition is a puzzle; it takes ≥3 seconds to identify the primary action. |

For full anchor examples and common scoring confusions, see `references/observational-rubrics.md`.

## Threshold

| Tier | Condition | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| pass | score ≥4 |: |
| warn | score = 3 | MEDIUM |
| fail | score ≤2 | HIGH |

## Fix

**If fail or warn:**

- Remove rotated, skewed, or overlapping decorative elements (tilted badges, angled banners, layered blobs).
- Adopt one grid; align every section, card, and figure to it. No off-grid one-offs.
- Resolve competing alignments: pick left, center, or right per section and hold it.
- Collapse near-duplicate shapes (two badges, two CTAs, two illustrations) to one dominant figure per section.
- Reduce decorative gradients and overlays so one figure-ground reading wins.

## Examples

**Anti-pattern (fails):**

```html
<section class="relative">
  <div class="absolute inset-0 -skew-y-3 bg-gradient-to-tr from-pink-200 to-yellow-200"></div>
  <div class="absolute right-10 top-10 rotate-12 rounded-full bg-purple-500 p-6">New!</div>
  <svg class="absolute left-0 top-0"><!-- decorative blob --></svg>
  <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-black/20 mix-blend-multiply"></div>
  <h1 class="relative text-4xl">Welcome</h1>
</section>
```

**Applied (passes):**

```html
<section class="bg-slate-50 py-24">
  <div class="mx-auto max-w-2xl text-center">
    <span class="inline-block rounded-full bg-blue-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm text-blue-700">
      New
    </span>
    <h1 class="mt-4 text-4xl font-semibold">Welcome</h1>
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600">Get started in under a minute.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```
