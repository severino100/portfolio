## Law of Uniform Connectedness

Gestalt grouping: items joined by an explicit visual connection (a line, bracket, shared background fill, or arrow) read as more strongly related than items grouped by any other cue. Uniform Connectedness is the strongest of the four grouping laws (Palmer & Rock 1994; lawsofux.com/law-of-uniform-connectedness): where it conflicts with Common Region, Proximity, or Similarity, connection wins.

Use it sparingly. A connecting line, shared row background, or pill container signals a tight relationship the eye accepts without question. Overuse makes it noise: every line is a claim about structure, and false claims confuse.

## Check

**Surfaces:** form, list

**Procedure:**
1. Find mutually-exclusive choices (radio sets, segmented controls, toggle groups, step indicators).
2. Check for a shared connector: shared background fill, a connecting line, or a single bordered container wrapping all options.
3. Verify the connector encompasses ALL options in the set, not a subset.

**Concrete commands:**
```bash
rg 'role="radiogroup"|type="radio"|<RadioGroup|Tabs|Segmented|ToggleGroup' src/
```

## Threshold

| Tier | Condition | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| pass | all radio/segmented/step sets share a connector that wraps every option |: |
| warn | connector incomplete (covers most but not all options, or wraps but with gaps) | MEDIUM |
| fail | no connector: radios or segments float apart with separate borders/gaps | HIGH |

## Fix

**If fail:** Wrap the set in a single container with a shared background (e.g. `<div class="inline-flex rounded-lg bg-slate-100 p-1">`) and remove per-option borders. For step indicators, draw a connecting line between steps.

**If warn:** Extend the connector to cover the missing option(s), or remove the gap between connected and disconnected items.

## Examples

**Anti-pattern (related controls float without connection):**

```html
<!-- Segmented filter: three buttons sit side by side with a gap between each.
     Users read them as three separate toggles, not as one mutually-exclusive control. -->
<div class="flex gap-2">
  <button class="rounded border px-3 py-1">All</button>
  <button class="rounded border px-3 py-1 bg-blue-600 text-white">Active</button>
  <button class="rounded border px-3 py-1">Archived</button>
</div>
```

**Applied (shared container connects the segment):**

```html
<div class="inline-flex rounded-lg bg-slate-100 p-1">
  <button class="rounded-md px-3 py-1 text-slate-600">All</button>
  <button class="rounded-md bg-white px-3 py-1 font-medium shadow-sm">Active</button>
  <button class="rounded-md px-3 py-1 text-slate-600">Archived</button>
</div>
```
