## Autonomous agent action without stakes-appropriate approval

Agent sends an email, posts to Slack, or deletes data without asking. Or it asks confirmation for every trivial action. Either extreme breaks trust. The approval model must match the stakes and reversibility of the action.

## What goes wrong

Scenario A: User says "clean up my calendar." Agent deletes meetings including one with the VP. No confirmation. Scenario B: Agent asks "Move report.pdf? [Yes/No]" for 40 files. User gives up at file 12. Both are approval mismatches.

## Detection

**Surfaces:** agent-tool-execution, agent-chat

**Auditability:** hybrid

**Static signals:**
1. Find agent-initiated side effects (send, delete, create, publish).
2. Classify by stakes and reversibility. Check whether approval precedes high-stakes actions.
3. Flag mismatches in both directions.

**Concrete commands:**
```bash
rg -l 'sendEmail|sendMessage|deleteAccount|publishPost|processPayment' --type=ts src/
rg -B 10 'sendEmail|delete|publish' --type=ts src/ | rg 'confirm|approval|modal'
```

**Judgment signals:**
- "User-requested" vs. "agent-initiated" matters. "Clean up my inbox" per-email = user-requested. Agent proactively acting = agent-initiated.
- A single "Are you sure?" for 50 actions is insufficient.

**False-positive guards:**
- Skip `// ax-audit-ignore:control-no-approval-gate`, test, and Storybook files.

## Fix

Implement the stakes x reversibility matrix. Low/easy: auto-apply. Low/hard: quick confirm. High/easy: show diff. High/hard: explicit modal approval.

## Examples

**Anti-pattern (fails):**

```tsx
async function handleSendEmail(draft: EmailDraft) {
  await emailClient.send(draft);
  return { status: "sent", message: `Email sent to ${draft.to}` };
}
```

**Applied (passes):**

```tsx
async function handleSendEmail(draft: EmailDraft, ctx: AgentContext) {
  const approved = await ctx.modalApproval({
    title: `Send email to ${draft.to}?`,
    preview: <EmailPreview draft={draft} />,
    actions: ["Send", "Edit", "Cancel"],
  });
  if (!approved) return { status: "cancelled" };
  await emailClient.send(draft);
  return { status: "sent" };
}
```

## Default tier and overrides

**Defaults to:** `release-blocker`

| Surface | Tier |
|---|---|
| Agent tool execution | release-blocker |
| Agent chat | release-blocker |
| Agent config | fix-this-sprint |
| Agent dashboard | fix-this-sprint |

## Suppression

```tsx
{/* ax-audit-ignore:control-no-approval-gate, user opted into auto-apply mode */}
<AutoApplyToggle enabled={userPreference.autoApply} />
```
