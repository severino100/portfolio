## No way to interrupt, redirect, or undo agent action

Agent starts a long response or multi-step workflow. User realizes it's wrong but there's no stop, undo, or "go back": they watch it do the wrong thing and can't intervene. Autonomy without exit is coercion.

## What goes wrong

User asks the agent to refactor a module. It begins a 12-step migration; at step 3 the user sees it's wrong. No stop button: it runs to completion, leaving the codebase in an unwanted state. Manual revert takes longer than doing it themselves.

## Detection

**Surfaces:** agent-chat, agent-tool-execution

**Auditability:** hybrid

**Static signals:**
1. Find agent execution UI (chat panels, action panels, tool execution views).
2. Check for cancel/stop during execution (`onCancel`, `AbortController`).
3. Check for undo/revert after completion. Flag flows with neither.

**Concrete commands:**
```bash
rg -l 'AbortController|onCancel|stopGenerat' --type=ts src/
rg -A 10 'isGenerating|isStreaming|isPending' --type=ts src/ | rg -v 'cancel|stop|abort'
```

**Judgment signals:**
- A cancel button not wired to `AbortController.abort()` is a false affordance, worse than nothing.

**False-positive guards:**
- Skip `// ax-audit-ignore:control-no-escape-hatch`, test, and Storybook files.

## Fix

During execution: stop button wired to `AbortController`. After completion: undo/revert for reversible actions. For irreversible actions, the approval gate (`control-no-approval-gate`) is the pre-execution escape hatch.

## Examples

**Anti-pattern (fails):**

```tsx
<div>
  {messages.map((m) => <Message key={m.id} {...m} />)}
  {isGenerating && <Spinner />}
  {/* no stop button, no undo */}
</div>
```

**Applied (passes):**

```tsx
<div>
  {messages.map((m) => <Message key={m.id} {...m} />)}
  {isGenerating && (
    <>
      <Spinner />
      <Button onClick={onStop} aria-label="Stop generating">Stop</Button>
    </>
  )}
  {!isGenerating && <Button onClick={onUndo} variant="ghost">Undo</Button>}
</div>
```

## Default tier and overrides

**Defaults to:** `release-blocker`

| Surface | Tier |
|---|---|
| Agent tool execution | release-blocker |
| Agent chat | release-blocker |
| Agent config | fix-this-sprint |
| Agent dashboard | fix-this-sprint |

## Suppression

```tsx
{/* ax-audit-ignore:control-no-escape-hatch, single status check, completes in <1s */}
<StatusCheckResult result={result} />
```
