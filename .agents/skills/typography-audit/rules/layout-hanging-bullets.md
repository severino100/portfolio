## Choose Hanging vs Indented Bullets

Wrapped list lines must align with each other, never under the bullet. `list-style-position: inside` wraps continuation lines under the bullet, breaking the left text edge. Use `outside` and pick hanging bullets (bullet in the margin) or indented (text indented from the margin). Indented is the safer web default; avoid hanging bullets on mobile where space is tight.

**Incorrect (inside positioning, wrapped lines misalign):**

```css
ul {
  list-style-position: inside;
  /* Second line of a long item wraps under the bullet,
     destroying the left text edge */
}
```

**Correct (outside positioning, pick hanging or indented):**

```css
/* Indented bullets: text indented from left edge (safer default) */
ul {
  list-style-position: outside;
  padding-left: 1.5em;
}

/* Hanging bullets: bullets hang in the margin (print-like) */
ul.hanging {
  list-style-position: outside;
  padding-left: 0;
  margin-left: 1em;
}
```

Add vertical spacing between bullet items to improve scannability.
