# Claim Verification

Verify claims with local evidence, not at face value. Load during plan review when a claim is locally checkable, or when the user asks to verify one.

## When to use

- Triage (Step 2): the plan asserts something checkable about the codebase, performance, or behavior
- Dialogue (Step 3): the user responds with a specific, verifiable claim
- Standalone: the user says "verify this", "is this true", "prove it", "check this claim"
- Before relying on an assumption that drives a critical decision

## Workflow

### 1. Restate as falsifiable hypothesis

Convert the claim into a testable statement: condition, metric, threshold.

| Claim | Falsifiable hypothesis |
|-------|----------------------|
| "This function is small" | `getUser` in `src/user.ts` is under 50 lines |
| "The API is fast" | `GET /api/users` responds in under 200ms locally |
| "We have good test coverage" | `src/auth/` directory has co-located test files for >80% of modules |
| "Nobody uses this" | `legacyHelper` has zero call sites outside its own test file |
| "This is thread-safe" | Concurrent writes to `cache.ts` don't produce data races under `--race` |

If it can't be restated falsifiably (too vague or unfalsifiable), say so and skip verification.

### 2. Identify the minimal evidence surface

Choose the smallest, most direct source:

| Evidence type | Tools | When to use |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| Code existence | `grep -r`, `find`, file reading | "Does X exist?", "Is Y used?" |
| Code metrics | `wc -l`, `tokei`, line counting | "How big is X?", "How many files?" |
| History | `git log`, `git blame`, `git shortlog` | "When was X added?", "Who wrote Y?" |
| Test output | `npm test`, `pytest`, `cargo test` | "Does X pass?", "Is Y covered?" |
| Runtime behavior | `curl`, `time`, script execution | "How fast is X?", "What does Y return?" |
| Static analysis | `tsc --noEmit`, `eslint`, `oxlint` | "Does X compile?", "Are there warnings?" |

### 3. Capture baseline artifact

Run the command and save raw output verbatim (exact command plus full output, no paraphrase). For before/after comparisons, capture the baseline first.

### 4. Capture treatment artifact (if comparing)

For change claims ("this is faster", "this reduces complexity"), capture the treatment state with the same command on the same machine.

### 5. Compare and verdict

Compare the artifacts. Three outcomes:

**VERIFIED**: evidence supports the claim within threshold.
```
Claim: "getUser is under 50 lines"
Evidence: wc -l src/user.ts → getUser function spans lines 12-38 (26 lines)
Verdict: VERIFIED, 26 lines, well under 50
```

**NOT VERIFIED**: evidence contradicts the claim.
```
Claim: "Nobody uses legacyHelper"
Evidence: grep -r "legacyHelper" src/ → 4 call sites in 3 files
Verdict: NOT VERIFIED, 4 active call sites found
```

**INCONCLUSIVE**: insufficient evidence or mixed signals.
```
Claim: "The API responds in under 200ms"
Evidence: 5 curl requests → 180ms, 210ms, 190ms, 350ms, 185ms
Verdict: INCONCLUSIVE, 3/5 under 200ms but p95 is 350ms. Depends on the threshold definition.
```

## Verifying against documentation

Some claims concern a *documented decision*, not code or runtime behavior ("the RFC says writes are idempotent", "the library supports retries natively", "the ADR rejected this approach"). Verify against the authoritative doc, not just the code.

1. **Find the authoritative source.** Closest-to-code first: ADRs/decision records, then design docs/RFCs, then official library/API docs. The user's named spec is the source of truth when one exists.
2. **Quote the relevant line.** Copy the exact sentence plus its location (file/path or doc name + section); do not paraphrase the decision.
3. **Check the doc against reality.** Docs drift. If the code contradicts the doc, that itself is the finding: report which is authoritative for this plan.
4. **Verdict.** Same three outcomes, with the citation:

```
Claim: "The payments RFC says webhook handling is idempotent"
Evidence: docs/rfc/payments.md §4: "handlers MUST dedupe on event_id before side effects"
         but src/webhooks/stripe.ts has no dedupe check on event_id
Verdict: NOT VERIFIED, RFC requires idempotency; current code does not implement it
```

If no authoritative doc exists, say so and fall back to code/runtime evidence. Never treat an undocumented assumption as verified.

## Output format

```markdown
**Claim:** <original claim>
**Hypothesis:** <falsifiable restatement>
**Evidence:** <command run and raw output>
**Verdict:** VERIFIED | NOT VERIFIED | INCONCLUSIVE
**Confidence:** High | Medium | Low
**Note:** <one line of context if needed>
```

## Integration with plan review

During triage (Step 2), verify the plan's load-bearing checkable claims before the dialogue; a NOT VERIFIED claim drops its dimension a point and becomes the first question.

During dialogue (Step 3), when the user responds with a verifiable claim:

1. Recognize it is checkable ("this is under 100 lines", "we already handle that case", "the test covers this")
2. Pause the dialogue
3. Run the verification workflow
4. Report the verdict with the raw evidence
5. Use the verdict to choose the next move: ACCEPT, PUSH DEEPER, or REFRAME

Do not verify every claim, only those load-bearing for a plan decision or that seem surprising.
