## Link to existing docs instead of re-explaining

If a concept is explained in another document, link to it; don't re-explain. Duplicate explanations drift apart: one gets updated while the other goes stale, and readers can't tell which is authoritative.

**Incorrect (re-explains webhook setup in every guide):**

```markdown
## Send notifications

To configure webhooks, create a JSON payload with the event type,
target URL, and authentication header. Set the retry policy to
exponential backoff with a maximum of 5 attempts...
```

**Correct (links to the canonical explanation):**

```markdown
## Send notifications

Configure a webhook to receive event callbacks. For setup
details, see [Configure webhooks](../reference/webhooks.md).
```
