## Delete outdated docs, don't leave them to rot

Outdated docs are worse than none: they actively mislead. Delete docs for removed features; update docs when behavior changes. If historical context is needed, use a collapsed `<details>` section, not stale inline content.

**Incorrect (doc for a removed feature still in navigation):**

```markdown
## XML export

Use the `/export/xml` endpoint to generate an XML report.
<!-- This endpoint was removed in v3.0 -->
```

**Correct (doc deleted, migration note added where needed):**

```markdown
<!-- xml-export.md deleted -->
<!-- All links updated to point to the JSON export doc -->

## JSON export

Use the `/export/json` endpoint. XML export was removed in v3.0.
For migration details, see [v3.0 changelog](changelog.md#v30).
```
