## Verify all links point to valid destinations

After any doc change, verify all outbound links still resolve, both internal doc links and external URLs. Automate the check in CI when possible.

**Incorrect (renamed doc without updating inbound links):**

```markdown
For setup instructions, see [Getting started](setup.md).
<!-- setup.md was renamed to getting-started.md -->
```

**Correct (links verified after every rename or restructure):**

```markdown
For setup instructions, see
[Getting started](getting-started.md).

<!-- CI runs markdown-link-check on every PR -->
```
