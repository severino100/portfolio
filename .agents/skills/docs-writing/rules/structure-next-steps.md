## Step 3: Verify the deployment

```markdown
## Step 3: Verify the deployment

Run the health check endpoint to confirm the service is running:

    curl https://api.example.com/health

## Next steps

- [Configure a custom domain](custom-domains.md) to serve your

- [Set up monitoring](monitoring.md) to get alerts when the
  health check fails.
- [Enable auto-scaling](auto-scaling.md) to handle traffic spikes.
