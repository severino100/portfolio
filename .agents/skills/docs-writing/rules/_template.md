Conventions:
- Filename: <prefix>-<slug>.md where <prefix> matches a section in _sections.md

- H2 title matches the frontmatter title
- The Incorrect/Correct parentheticals name the specific failure/fix, not just "bad"/"good"
- Use ````markdown fences (four backticks) when the example itself contains code fences
- Adding or removing a rule: update the count in _sections.md, the SKILL.md priority table, and the SKILL.md description
