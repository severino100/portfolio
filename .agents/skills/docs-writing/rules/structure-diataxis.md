## One doc type per file

Per Diataxis, each document is exactly one type: tutorial, how-to, reference, or explanation. Each serves a different need and reading mode, so mixing them confuses readers. When a doc drifts into another type, split into separate files and link between them.

**Incorrect (mixed tutorial, reference, and explanation in one file):**

```markdown
# Authentication

## Getting started with auth
Follow these steps to add login to your app...

## API reference
### POST /auth/token
Parameters:
- grant_type (required): The OAuth grant type...

## How authentication works
The system uses a three-legged OAuth flow where...
```

**Correct (separate files, each one type):**

```markdown
<!-- tutorial-authentication.md -->
# Tutorial: Add login to your app
Follow these steps to add authentication...

<!-- reference-auth-api.md -->
# Auth API reference
### POST /auth/token
Parameters:
- grant_type (required): The OAuth grant type...

<!-- explanation-auth-architecture.md -->
# How authentication works
The system uses a three-legged OAuth flow where...
