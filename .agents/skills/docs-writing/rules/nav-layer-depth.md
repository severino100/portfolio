## Layer content depth with links for different skill levels

Give a summary for quick readers and link to deeper explanations. Experts skip the links; beginners click through. Pages stay focused without leaving anyone behind.

**Incorrect (either too shallow or too deep):**

```markdown
## Authentication

Use API keys.
```

```markdown
## Authentication

API keys are cryptographic strings that identify the calling
application. They use HMAC-SHA256 to sign requests. The key
derivation function applies PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations...
```

**Correct (summary with link to deeper content):**

```markdown
## Authentication

Requests are authenticated with API keys passed in the
`Authorization` header. For details on key rotation and
scoping, see [API key management](api-keys.md).
```
