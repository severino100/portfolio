## Every heading needs an intro paragraph

Never follow a heading directly with a subheading, list, or code block. Add at least one sentence on what the section covers and why it matters; one sentence is enough to orient the reader.

**Incorrect (heading jumps straight to a list):**

```markdown
## Configuration

- `DB_HOST`: The database hostname
- `DB_PORT`: The database port
- `DB_NAME`: The database name
```

**Correct (heading followed by an intro sentence):**

```markdown
## Configuration

Configure the database connection by setting these environment
variables in your `.env` file.

- `DB_HOST`: The database hostname (default: `localhost`)
- `DB_PORT`: The database port (default: `5432`)
- `DB_NAME`: The database name
```

This applies to a heading followed by a subheading too: add a sentence between them.
