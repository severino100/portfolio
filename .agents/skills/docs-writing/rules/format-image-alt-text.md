## Write descriptive alt text for all images

Every image needs alt text conveying the information it provides. Describe what the image shows, not what it is. Empty or generic alt text like "screenshot" leaves screen reader users with no context.

**Incorrect (missing or generic alt text):**

```markdown
![Screenshot](auth-flow.png)

![Image 1](deployment-diagram.png)
```

**Correct (alt text describes the content):**

```markdown
![Authentication flow showing OAuth redirect from client to provider and back](auth-flow.png)

![Deployment architecture with load balancer routing to three app servers](deployment-diagram.png)
```
