## Document errors with codes, meanings, and fixes

Don't just list error codes. Show the message, explain the cause, and give the fix. Readers reach for error docs when stuck.

**Incorrect (error code with no actionable guidance):**

```markdown
| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 403  | Forbidden   |
| 429  | Rate limited |
```

**Correct (each error includes cause and fix):**

```markdown
### 403 Forbidden

Your API key doesn't have permission for this endpoint. Check
that your key has the `billing:read` scope in the
[API dashboard](https://dashboard.acme.com/keys).

### 429 Too Many Requests

You exceeded 100 requests per minute. Add exponential backoff
to your retry logic or request a rate limit increase in the
[API dashboard](https://dashboard.acme.com/limits).
```
